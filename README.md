Hi I'm @soulCrona
I like all sorts of things, some of these things mucking aruond with code. Fire dancing primarily with pois and staffs. I also love as generic as it sounds walking aimlessly for hours

Im currently learning multiple kinds of dance and taking theatre classes.

And of course programing wise. I am trying to get better with my game development skills in unity. Because I love mucking around and creating random stuff that I can
look at and laugh at.
